  abstract = {What drives people?s perceptions of novel risks, and how malleable are such risk perceptions? Psychological research has identified multiple potential drivers of risk perception, but no studies have yet tested within a unified analytic framework how well each of these drivers accounts for individual differences in large population samples. To provide such a framework, I harnessed the deployment of 5G?the latest generation of cellular network technology. Specifically, I conducted a multiverse analysis using a representative population sample in Switzerland (Study 1; N = 2,919 individuals between 15 and 94 years old), finding that interindividual differences in risk perceptions were strongly associated with hazard-related drivers (e.g., trust in the institutions regulating 5G, dread) and person-specific drivers (e.g., electromagnetic hypersensitivity)?and strongly predictive of people?s policy-related attitudes (e.g., voting intentions). Further, a field experiment based on a national expert report on 5G (N = 839 individuals in a longitudinal sample between 17 and 79 years old) identified links between intraindividual changes in psychological drivers and perceived risk, thus highlighting potential targets for future policy interventions.},

  abstract = {Representative design refers to the idea that experimental stimuli should be sampled or designed such that they represent the environments to which measured constructs are supposed to generalize. In this article we investigate the role of representative design in achieving valid and reliable psychological assessments, by focusing on a widely used behavioral measure of risk taking—the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Specifically, we demonstrate that the typical implementation of this task violates the principle of representative design, thus conflicting with the expectations people likely form from real balloons. This observation may provide an explanation for the previously observed limitations in some of the BART’s psychometric properties (e.g., convergent validity with other measures of risk taking). To experimentally test the effects of improved representative designs, we conducted two extensive empirical studies (N = 772 and N = 632), finding that participants acquired more accurate beliefs about the optimal behavior in the BART because of these task adaptions. Yet, improving the task’s representativeness proved to be insufficient to enhance the BART’s psychometric properties. It follows that for the development of valid behavioral measurement instruments—as are needed, for instance, in functional neuroimaging studies—our field has to overcome the philosophy of the “repair program” (i.e., fixing existing tasks). Instead, we suggest that the development of valid task designs requires novel ecological assessments, aimed at identifying those real-life behaviors and associated psychological processes that lab tasks are supposed to capture and generalize to.},

  abstract = {A person’s risk preference may determine significant life outcomes (e.g., in finance or health), and people are therefore routinely asked to report their risk preferences in various scientific and applied contexts. Yet, still little is known concerning the cognitive underpinnings of this judgment-formation process. We ran two studies (N = 250, and N = 150 in a retest) implementing the process-tracing method of aspect listing, to investigate the information-integration processes underlying people’s self-reports by means of cognitive modeling (RQ1), as well as to examine people’s cognitive representations of their risk preferences (RQ2). Our analyses indicate that interindividual differences in self-reported risk preferences can be modeled well based on the listed aspects’ properties of evidence and substantially better than using sociodemographic variables as predictors. Specifically, to render self-reports people appear to integrate the strength of evidence of multiple aspects sampled from memory. These aspects further revealed that people’s cognitive representation of their risk preferences mostly relate to the magnitudes of outcomes and often to explicit trade-offs between positive and negative outcomes, in line with a risk–return perspective. Crucially, within participants the strength of evidence of the listed aspects remained highly stable across the two studies (RQ3), and changes therein were closely related to changes in self-reported risk preference (RQ4). In sum, our findings provide insight into the cognitive processes of how people render self-reports of their risk preferences, suggest an explanation for the well-documented temporal stability thereof, and thus corroborate the internal validity of this measurement approach.},
